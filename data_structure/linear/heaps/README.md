# Heaps

A heap is a data structure that is based on the heap property. The heap data structure is used in selection, graph, and k-way merge algorithms. Operations such as finding, merging, insertion, key changes, and deleting are performed on heaps. Heaps are part of the container/heap package in Go. According to the heap order (maximum heap) property, the value stored at each node is greater than or equal to its children.
