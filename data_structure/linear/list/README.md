# List

### Definition
A list is a sequence of elements. Each element can be connected to another with a link in a forward or backward direction. The element can have other payload properties. This data structure is a basic type of container. Lists have a variable length and developer can remove or add elements more easily than an array. Data items within a list need not be contiguous in memory or on disk. Linked lists were proposed by Allen Newell, Cliff Shaw, and Herbert A. Simon at RAND Corporation.

To get started, a list can be used in Go, as shown in the following example; elements are added through the PushBack method on the list, which is in the container/list
